# Redux-Feedback-Loop


## Description

This app utilizes redux to store local feedback input before eventually posting that information to a database at a review/confirmation page. By using react the app is able to modify the display as it carries data thoughout the process, and show the users their previous inputs before it is submitted finally. This acts a form of quality control, and prevents users from submitting inaccurate data, or data they may have changed their mind about. The addition of an admin page allows the ability to view all the feedback currently on the database.
